# Edithon (edih-thon)
**Edithon is a voice assistant that is simple to use, modify, and even has tons of space for your own programs.** Edithon was started when I was trying to make a pair of smart glasses, but could not get the hardware for the glasses in time. Because of this, I was left with a software voice assistant that I could not use, but I didn't know if someone else had a better use for it, so I decided to post it on Github. I have removed all of the smart glasses code so that you can build whatever you want. Please use this as a base for your projects, as I want to see the potential that this project could have had.


# Files
There are 2 different files in this program. 'main' is the brains of the entire assistant. It contains all of the different statements, and is where everything is based on. 'commands' is where the commands are stored, and where the main program will access in order to determine what to run. In the future I will be adding a web file so that the user can easily add their own functions using that web program as opposed to directly modifying edithon, and possibly risking errors.
## Creating Functions
In short:
In order to create a new function, edit the commands document, and add your very own function to the program. **Be sure to also add your function to the function dictionary for Edithon to access your commands.**

In the future there will be a more detailed video guide on how to make your own functions, but as we are currently in the alpha state of this project, this will have to wait.
## Example Edithon Projects

Coming Soon! Let me know what you made with Edithon by emailing me at 'shivenvermabuisness(at)gmail.com' . The @ sign was replaced with (at) to avoid email bots scraping for spam.



## Updates and Revisions

As this is not my main priority (I am still in school) please understand that I will not be constantly updating this unless there is an issue that completely threatens the entire program. If it is something small like a bug or an error I would advise your to make an issue request and have someone else try and help you out, otherwise you will have to troubleshoot on your own. 

## Licensing and Usage.

If you are planning to use this for a personal project (Non-Profit and Non-Commerical) then feel free to use this without contacting me, but please make sure to not claim Edithon as your own, and credit me (Shiven Verma) somewhere in your project. 

If you are planning to use it commericially, contact me at 'shivenvermabuisness(at)gmail.com', and we can discuss.
## Disclaimer

**Please understand that this was not made to be beginner friendly, it was made to be as functional as I could make it be. It is for this reason that I do not recommend you to use this if you don't have a proper understanding of the language, as you may struggle in using this program. This does not mean that as a beginner you cannot use this, I just won't be helping you every single step along the way since I still am a full-time student.**.
